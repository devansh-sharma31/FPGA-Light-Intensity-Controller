# FPGA-Based Light Intensity Controller using FSM

This project implements a Light Intensity Detection and Control System
using Verilog and a Finite State Machine (FSM). The design dynamically
adjusts light intensity based on input conditions and is verified
through simulation and FPGA implementation on Basys-3.

## Features
- FSM-based adaptive control
- Synthesizable Verilog design
- RTL simulation with testbench
- FPGA implementation on Basys-3

## Tools
Verilog, Vivado, Basys-3 FPGA

## Status
✔ RTL complete  
✔ Testbench verified  
✔ FPGA tested
